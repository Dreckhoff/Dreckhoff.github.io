    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Johannes, welcome to my website. I am a physics student at the university of Heidelberg, Germany. Currently, I am 
        writing my master thesis in theoretical biophysics in the Schwarz group at the BioQuant.</p>

    <h3 id="bachelor-thesis">Bachelor Thesis</h3>
    <p>
        I wrote my bachelor thesis in 2023 under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Andreas Mielke at the institute for theoretical
        physics in Heidelberg, Germany. I wanted to tackle the question: "Why is everything we see in nature so sharp?" If you look
        at the stripes of a zebra, why isn't there a blurry mess? <br />

        In non-technical terms, think of a stadium packed with people. Every possible pattern is like a different chant trying to get started in the crowd. 
        So how does one chant take over the whole stadium?
        It turns out that the competition between different chants is selecting the most popular one. People around it are not only
        hearing it, their chant is actively shut down, they stop and join in (in technical terms, nonlinear feedback suppression).
        This mechanism selects a single chant in the end, and the whole stadium is chanting the same thing. <br />

        I could show that this essentially happens in cell membranes in the case of pattern formation in lipid cell membranes.

    <h3 id="master-thesis">Master Thesis</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently working on my master thesis in the field of theoretical and computational biophysics in the
      Schwarz group at the BioQuant in Heidelberg. My research focuses on the curvature generation during
      clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Basically, the cell has too little interest in wrapping around stuff it wants to eat,
      so it gets help from a protein called clathrin, that forms a grid on the cell membrane that eventually starts to bend.
      But the details of how and why are not yet understood completely. <br />

      I am tackling this problem by writing a programm that should simulate the accumulation of clathrin as well as the generation
      of curvature during endocytosis (the process in which the cell wraps around the stuff it wants to eat). For this, I am
      using an (i.m.o.) interesting approach with JAX (a programming library usually used for machine learning) together 
      with pythons object-oriented programming style, to create an easy-to-manage software that is still very fast. <br />

      Currently, the project is still going on, but I will update this section at the given time.
